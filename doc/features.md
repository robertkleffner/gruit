Planned Features of Gruit
=========================

1. pattern matching
    1. extended with multiple sequence variables
2. intensional type analysis because I don't know how to implement type classes
    1. and they seem finicky with type inference anyway
3. effects a la Leijen (Koka)
4. units a la Flatt & Felleisen
5. extensible records and variants a la Leijen again
6. user-defined algebraic data types (standard, but ML?)
7. compile-time checked laws and examples
